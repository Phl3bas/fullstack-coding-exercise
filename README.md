# Fullstack Coding Exercise

Create a web application that displays all the registered users for a product and filters the users by name. The table should show each users name, location and email address. The data for the users should be requested from a REST API.

A sample dataset of users is [supplied](/fresh8gaming/fullstack-coding-exercise/blob/main/sampledata.json).

## User story

- As a user, I can see all the registers users in the system
- Each user should have a name, email and location
- I can search by name and see users that match my input

## Technical Requirements

- We'd like you to use React but add whatever UI framework you feel comfortable with
- Typescript is acceptable but not required
- Use any libraries you think you need
- The backend should provide a REST endpoint to return the user data
- Provide tests
- Authentication is out of the scope of this exercise

## Notes

Take as little or as much time on this as you feel you need. Your time is valuable, so we wouldn't expect you to take more than 2-3 hours on this.

We're interested in your approach and ideas as much as we are a working app, so don't worry if something is not perfect. Just tell us how you would improve it given more time.

## Submission

Please commit your application to a github repository and share with user `samstefan`
